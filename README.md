# 🧑‍💻 My Coding Playground  

Hello and welcome! 👋  

This is a place where I throw all my practice projects, experiments, and random ideas.  
Some work, some don't, some are in-progress, while some are deserted and that’s totally okay.  

Think of this repo as my coding backyard — messy, fun, and full of learning.  
Feel free to look around, get inspired, or just laugh at the mess I've created. 😅  

Happy exploring! 🚀
